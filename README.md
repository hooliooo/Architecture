# Architecture

Architecture is a package that contains the basic building blocks I use to create Swift applications using Hexagonal Architecture with 
Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and an element of Clean Architecture (use cases). 
Domain-driven Design as the software development approach.

The package is separated into three libraries:
* Clean - contains the building blocks related to Clean Architecture
* CQRS - contains the building blocks related to CQRS
* DomainDrivenDesign - contains the building blocks related to Domain-driven Design
